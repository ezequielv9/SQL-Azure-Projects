# SQL-Azure-Projects

This is going to be a DB related to the best-selling games in the Nintendo Console.

My First Task is to create the (Data Factory using Azure).

The second Task is to link this to an Azure Data Brinks session

The third task would be to create a Resource Group, Storage Acct, and finally a Synapse WorkSpace.

Synapse could be the one and only application I would need to Create the Data Lake and Data Factory however this is to showcase my proficiency in the other Software and see where my capabilities are at right now.

The final step is using Power Bi or Tablue to create the Data visualization of this Project and Develop the questions for the SQL Queries.
